# Contributing to This Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing! To ensure that all contributions are legally sound and can be used in both open-source and closed-source versions of this project (if one is ever made), we require all contributors to sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

- All contributions to this repository must be covered by our CLA.
- The CLA ensures that:
  - You retain authorship credit for your work.
  - You grant the project owner an **exclusive copyright license** to your contributions.
  - This allows the project to distribute code under open-source terms **and** to use contributions in future closed-source editions, if such should happen. It also allows us to change the license of Nortantis's code to any other open source license recognized by the The Free Software Organization (FSO).

## Signing the CLA

- When you open a Pull Request, [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) will automatically check whether you have signed the CLA.
- If you haven’t signed yet, you’ll see a comment with a link to the agreement.
- Please read the agreement carefully and sign it before your PR can be merged.

## Contribution Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create your branch.
2. Make your changes and commit with clear messages.
3. Open a Pull Request.
4. Sign the CLA when prompted.
5. Once the CLA is signed and your PR is reviewed, it can be merged.

## Notes

- Even small changes (like typo fixes) require signing the CLA, since every contribution is legally significant.
- If you are contributing on behalf of an organization, please ensure the **Entity Fiduciary Contributor License Agreement (EFCLA)** is signed by an authorized representative.
