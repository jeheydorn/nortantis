# nortantis
Nortantis is a fantasy map generator and editor originally created as an academic project. It uses a simple tectonic plate simulation to create islands and continents with trees, rivers, and mountains. The result has the appearance of an old-fashioned hand-drawn map.

For more information and examples of generated maps, see the project page <a href="https://jandjheydorn.com/nortantis">here</a>.

If you wish to build Nortantis from source rather than use the installers, do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Checkout the source code.</li>
	<li>Install Java JDK 25 or later. How to do that will depend on your OS. A good internet search should tell you how.</li>
	<li>In a command prompt, navigate to the top 'nortantis' folder in the source code, then run this command: ./gradlew :run
</ol>

Privacy policy: This program will not transfer any information to other networked systems unless specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it. (I had to add this for digital signing. Nortantis doesn't transfer any personal information.)
